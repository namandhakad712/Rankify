# üêõ CRITICAL BUG FIX - API Key Truncation

## The Bug
**Location:** `apps/shared/app/utils/geminiAPIClient.ts` line 369

**Problem:** The API key was being truncated for logging and that truncated version was used in the actual API request!

### Before (BROKEN ‚ùå):
```javascript
const url = `${this.baseURL}/models/${this.config.model}:${endpoint}?key=${this.config.apiKey.substring(0, 10)}...`

const response = await fetch(url, {  // Using truncated key!
  method: 'POST',
  headers: { 'Content-Type': 'application/json' },
  body: JSON.stringify(payload)
})
```

**Result:** API received only first 10 characters of the key + "..." ‚Üí `400 Bad Request: API key not valid`

### After (FIXED ‚úÖ):
```javascript
// Build the actual URL with the FULL API key
const url = `${this.baseURL}/models/${this.config.model}:${endpoint}?key=${this.config.apiKey}`

// Log URL with truncated key for security
const logUrl = `${this.baseURL}/models/${this.config.model}:${endpoint}?key=${this.config.apiKey.substring(0, 10)}...`

console.log(`üì° URL:`, logUrl)  // Log truncated version

const response = await fetch(url, {  // Use FULL key!
  method: 'POST',
  headers: { 'Content-Type': 'application/json' },
  body: JSON.stringify(payload)
})
```

## Why This Happened
The developer wanted to hide the full API key in console logs (good security practice), but accidentally used the truncated URL for the actual API request instead of just for logging.

## Impact
- ‚ùå **ALL API requests were failing** with "API key not valid"
- ‚ùå No PDF extraction was working
- ‚ùå Users thought their API keys were wrong

## Testing
After this fix, the API should work with valid Gemini API keys:
1. ‚úÖ Full API key is sent to Google
2. ‚úÖ Only truncated key appears in console logs (security)
3. ‚úÖ PDF extraction should work

## Related Changes
This fix works together with the previous Gemini Vision optimization where we:
- Removed unnecessary PDF.js text extraction
- Send raw PDF directly to Gemini Vision API
- Support scanned PDFs with built-in OCR
