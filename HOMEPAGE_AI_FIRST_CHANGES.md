# Homepage Changes: AI-First Approach

## 🎯 Problem
The AI Extractor was hidden behind a `v-if="aiExtractionEnabled"` condition and wasn't prominently displayed as the PRIMARY option on the homepage.

## ✅ Solution Applied

### 1. **Added Prominent AI CTA Banner** (NEW)
```vue
<!-- Large, eye-catching banner at the top -->
<div class="bg-gradient-to-r from-blue-500 to-purple-600 rounded-2xl p-8 text-white shadow-2xl">
  <h2>⚡ Try AI-Powered Extraction Now!</h2>
  <p>10x faster than manual cropping</p>
  <button>Start AI Extraction</button>
  <button>Or Use Manual Cropper</button>
</div>
```

**Location:** Right after hero section, before quick start cards
**Purpose:** Make AI extraction the obvious first choice

---

### 2. **Enhanced Hero Section**
**Before:**
```
🚀 Rankify - AI-Powered PDF to CBT Transformation
Transform your PDF question papers...
```

**After:**
```
🚀 Rankify - AI-Powered PDF to CBT Transformation
Transform your PDF question papers using advanced AI...

[⚡ AI Extraction in Seconds]
[✓ Confidence Scoring]
[📴 Offline Fallback Available]
```

**Changes:**
- Emphasized "advanced AI" in bold
- Added 3 feature badges showing key benefits
- Made it clear offline is a fallback, not primary

---

### 3. **Updated Quick Start Cards**

#### AI Extractor Card (ENHANCED)
**Before:**
- Hidden behind `v-if="aiExtractionEnabled"`
- Same visual weight as other cards
- Generic description

**After:**
- ✅ Always visible (removed v-if)
- ⚡ "AI-Powered" badge in corner
- 🎨 Thicker border (border-2 border-blue-400)
- 📝 Better description: "Extract questions automatically in seconds!"
- 🔵 Primary blue color scheme

#### PDF Cropper Card (REPOSITIONED)
**Before:**
- "Manual question extraction"

**After:**
- "Manual question extraction (offline-capable)"
- Positioned as alternative, not primary
- Button text: "Use Manual Tool" (was "Use Tool")

---

### 4. **AI Workflow Section**
**Before:**
```vue
<div v-if="aiExtractionEnabled" class="...">
  Complete AI-Powered Workflow
</div>
```

**After:**
```vue
<div class="...">  <!-- Removed v-if -->
  🚀 Complete AI-Powered Workflow (Recommended)
  10x faster than manual cropping.
</div>
```

**Changes:**
- ✅ Always visible (removed conditional rendering)
- Added "(Recommended)" label
- Added "10x faster" claim
- Thicker border to stand out

---

### 5. **Feature Flag Enforcement**
**Added to script section:**
```typescript
// Force enable AI extraction if not already enabled
if (!aiExtractionEnabled.value) {
  console.log('⚠️ AI extraction was disabled, enabling it now')
  featureFlags.enable('ai_extraction')
}
```

**Purpose:** Ensure AI features are always available for online-first approach
