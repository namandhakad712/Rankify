        <ul class="list-disc list-outside mt-2 text-left ml-8">
          <li class="mt-2">
            Test Interface requires the zip file (or pdf & json file) of PDF Cropper.<br>
            If you had generated answer key data, and chose "zip" or "json (merged)" as the format, then you can upload this file instead. As the zip or json (merged) is nothing but cropper data with answer key data also in it
          </li>
          <li class="mt-2">
            Do set the settings like time duration of test, test name etc under the "Test Settings" section.
          </li>
          <li class="mt-2">
            Load that zip file (or pdf & json file) in the test interface.
          </li>
          <li class="mt-2">
            After loading file(s), you will have <strong>Sort Sections Order</strong> & <strong>Questions Numbering Order</strong>:<br>
            <ul class="list-disc list-outside mt-2 text-left ml-10">
              <li class="mt-2">
                <strong>Sort Sections Order:</strong> As it speaks for itself, it allows you to sort the order of how the sections appear.
                This is useful if your pdf didn't have subject/sections in the order of how it is given in the real exam.
                For Example, JEE mains has Maths, Physics, Chemistry as the order of subjects, so if your pdf had subjects in PCM order then you can change it to MPC order.
              </li>
              <li class="mt-2">
                <strong>Questions Numbering Order:</strong> Now if you changed the order of sections or you may have questions in your pdf which has a different numbering order as it is in the real exam.
                So for example, your pdf has PCM where each has numbering like 1-25, 1-25, 1-25, now JEE Mains has numbering order of 1-75, yes they are continuing the numbering.<br><br>
                Using this, you can redefine how the question numbers appear as follows:
                <ul class="list-disc list-outside mt-2 text-left ml-10">
                  <li>
                    <strong>Original:</strong> Just uses the original numbering as it is in the uploaded file (cropper data).
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    <strong>Cumulative:</strong> Numbering is started with 1, and keeps continuing across sections.<br>
                    For Example: If you have 75 questions, then numbering will start with 1 and end with 75 (1-75).
                    This is what JEE mains uses.
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    <strong>Section-wise:</strong> Numbering resets to 1 in each section.
                    For Example: If you have 3 sections having 25 questions each, then numbering of questions in each section will be 1-25, 1-25, 1-25.
                  </li>
                </ul>
              </li>
            </ul>
          </li>
          <li class="mt-2">
            (OPTIONAL) You can optionally customize the UI of Test Interface (here's a video on this
