                        <strong>How it works:</strong> You set the boundaries in this order:
                        left, right, top, and bottom. After cropping one region,
                        the left and right boundaries are reused by default.
                        You can skip a region when setting the bottom boundary by
                        right-clicking and selecting
                        <strong>Skip Next Bottom Line</strong>,
                        or by holding the <strong>SHIFT key</strong>.

                  <li>
                    <strong>Box Mode:</strong> Works like image cropping.
                    Simply draw a box around the question to define the crop area.

                    It is recommended to follow the <strong>"SubjectName Section SectionNumber"</strong> format (e.g. Physics Section 1) as

                    It's recommended to use the same question number as in your source PDF.
                    This helps you map questions easily.<br>
                    If you're wondering about following your target exam's numbering style,
                    for example, in <strong>JEE Main</strong>,
                    the question numbers are continuous across sections (i.e. from Q1 to Q75)
                    but say your source PDF has separate numbering (1-25, 1-25, 1-25) then don't worry as
                    CBT Interface provides an option to reformat how numbering appears during test configuration.

                    <strong>MSM:</strong> Multiple Select Matrix,
                    this is a question format used by JEE Advanced uptill 2015.<br>
                    In this format, you have 2 columns say column A and column B,
                    options in column A can match with one or more options of column B.
                    So it basically is one to many (or one) matching.
                    If you look carefully this basically becomes a matrix, where rows options in column A and columns are options in column B.

                    For <strong>MCQ</strong> and <strong>MSQ</strong> types,
                    input a number (e.g. 4 for A, B, C, D).<br>
                    For <strong>MSM</strong> type, input total rows (options in column 1)
                    and total columns (options in column 2) in mxn format respectively (e.g. 4x6, which gives A to D as rows and P to U as columns).<br>
                    Also in <strong>MSM</strong> type, for square matrix,
                    while you can use mxn (m = n) format, you can also enter just m (e.g. 4x4 or just 4).

                  <li><strong>Incorrect:</strong> Marks deducted for an incorrect answer. For MSM type, this is marks deducted per incorrect row.</li>
                  <li>
                    <strong>Partial (Only for MSQ):</strong> Marks awarded
                    <strong>per correct option</strong>.<br>
                    This applies when the selected options are a subset of the correct ones
                    (i.e. partially correct).<br>
                    For example, <strong>JEE Advanced</strong> uses this logic, awarding
                    <strong>+1</strong> per correct option.<br>
                    If the correct answers are A, B, and D, and you select A and B,
                    then you'll receive 2 x partial marks.
                    If partial marks = +1, you'll receive <strong>+2</strong>.

            Bulk Edit (Includes Optional Questions)

                Bulk Edit allows you to set or change data on a group of questions, sections, or subjects.
              </p>
              <p>
                While all fields are self-explanatory on the Bulk Edit dialog itself,
                the following points provide more clarity:
              </p>
              <ul class="list-disc ml-6 [&>li]:mt-3">
                <li>
                  Data fields that will be changed after applying changes are highlighted in green.
                </li>
                <li>
                  When you click on "Load Data" after selecting a group/bulk,
                  the tool fetches existing data fields for the selection.<br>
                  If a data field has the same value across all questions,
                  it will be loaded as the initial value.<br>
                  If even one question has a different value for that field,
                  it will be shown as "No Changes" or left empty.
                </li>
                <li>
                  Changes are applied logically.
                  For example, if your bulk includes both MCQ and NAT questions,
                  and you change the number of answer options to 6,
                  this change will only apply to MCQs.<br>
                  Since NAT questions don't have answer options, that field is ignored for them.

                  <strong>Optional Questions (JEE Main pre-2025 format)</strong>:<br>
                  You can set sections that contain optional questions via Bulk Edit.<br>
                  First, crop all the questions. Once done, open Bulk Edit.<br>
                  On Bulk Edit, select the section that should have optional questions and load it.<br>
                  Set the <strong>Optional Questions</strong> field
                  to the number of optional questions in that section,
                  for <strong>JEE Mains pre-2025 format</strong> it is <strong>5</strong>.<br>
                  Apply the changes and repeat the same for other relevant sections.

                  <strong>Swapping Subject/Section:</strong><br>
                  If you want to change the current subject or section name to one that already exists,<br>
                  then the process is similar to how we rename a file.<br>
                  For example:<br>

                  Suppose the current subject is <strong>Chemistry</strong>
                  and the section is <strong>Chemistry Section 2</strong>.<br>
                  You want to change it to <strong>Physics</strong> and <strong>Physics Section 2</strong>,
                  which already exist.<br>
                  Follow these steps:
                  <ul class="list-disc pl-6 mt-2">
                    <li>Select the <strong>Physics Section 2</strong> group and load it.</li>
                    <li>
                      Temporarily rename <strong>Physics</strong> and <strong>Physics Section 2</strong>
                      to something else, say <strong>Temp Subject</strong> and <strong>Temp Section</strong>, then apply the changes.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                      Now load <strong>Chemistry Section 2</strong>.
                      Rename it to <strong>Physics</strong> and <strong>Physics Section 2</strong>, then apply the changes.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                      The goal has been achieved.
                      Now, the section we named <strong>Temp Subject</strong> &amp; <strong>Temp Section</strong>
                      can be renamed to something else.<br>
                      For example, if the goal was swapping,
                      then rename <strong>Temp Subject</strong> &amp; <strong>Temp Section</strong>
                      back to <strong>Chemistry</strong> &amp; <strong>Chemistry Section 2</strong> respectively,
                      and apply the changes.

                    <strong>Merging two cropped regions (or areas) into one question:</strong><br>
                    You can merge two cropped regions into one question by giving them the same
                    <strong>Subject Name</strong>, <strong>Section Name</strong>,
                    and <strong>Question Number</strong>.<br>
                    This is useful when a question's parts span across multiple pages.<br>
                    Crop the first part on the current page as usual.<br>
                    Then go to the next page to crop the other part and
                    make sure to use the <strong>same question number</strong>
                    (you'll need to manually decrease it by 1,
                    because it auto-increments after every crop).<br><br>
                    <strong>Example:</strong><br>
                    Say the current question number is 3.<br>
                    You crop the first part on the current page,
                    the tool will auto-increment the question number by 1 making it 4.<br>
                    Now go to the next page and set the question number back to 3,
                    then crop the other part.<br>
                    Both images will now be grouped as one question
                    since they share the same subject, section, and question number.

                    <strong>How to crop questions divided by columns using Line Cropper Mode:</strong><br>
                    <strong>Image 1</strong> above is an example.<br>
                    Questions 6 to 8 are on the left side and 9 to 12 on the right side.<br>
                    In Box Cropper Mode, cropping this is easy due to its free-style nature,
                    but it's trickier in Line Cropper Mode.<br>
                    Since Line Cropper works by defining left and right boundaries,
                    you first set them for the questions on the left.<br>
                    After cropping questions 6 to 8, you need to undo the left, right
                    and top boundaries to set new ones around the questions on the right side.<br>
                    Check the <strong>Context Menus</strong> panel above for instructions on how to do this.

                    ----- Para / Table -----<br>
                    ----- Q 13 -----<br>
                    ----- Q 14 -----<br>
                    ----- Q 15 -----<br><br>

                    We want to convert it into:<br>

                    ----- Para / Table -----<br>
                    ----- Q 13 -----<br>
                    ----- Para / Table -----<br>
                    ----- Q 14 -----<br>
                    ----- Para / Table -----<br>
                    ----- Q 15 -----<br><br>

                    So we want the Para/Table to appear in each question.<br>
                    Here's how we do it:<br>
                    First, crop the Para and give it question number 13.<br>
                    Then crop Q13, also assigning it question number 13,
                    this merges the Para and Q13 as one question.<br>
                    Switch to <strong>Edit</strong> mode, right-click (or long-press on touch)
                    the Para/Table cropped region, and copy its location.<br>
                    Press ESC or click blank space to unselect, set the question number to 14,
                    then right-click and paste.<br>
                    This creates a new region on the same Para for question 14.<br>
                    Switch back to <strong>Crop</strong> mode,
                    crop Q14 with question number 14 to merge it with the Para.<br>
                    Repeat the same for Q15.<br>
                    That's it!
