# AI Extractor Improvements Summary

## 1. ‚úÖ Answer Extraction Added
**Updated:** `apps/shared/app/utils/geminiAPIClient.ts`

### What Changed:
- Enhanced Gemini prompt to extract **correct answers** from PDFs
- Now extracts:
  - MCQ answers (single option)
  - MSQ answers (multiple options array)
  - NAT answers (numerical values)
  - Answer keys from separate sections

### Prompt Updates:
```
- correctAnswer: the correct answer(s) if provided in the PDF
  * For MCQ: single option (e.g., "A" or "Paris")
  * For MSQ: array of correct options (e.g., ["A", "C"])
  * For NAT: numerical value (e.g., "78.54")
  * If answer is NOT provided in PDF, set to null
```

### Export JSON Now Includes:
```json
{
  "questions": [
    {
      "id": 1,
      "text": "What is the capital of France?",
      "type": "MCQ",
      "options": ["Paris", "London", "Berlin", "Madrid"],
      "correctAnswer": "Paris",  // ‚Üê NOW EXTRACTED!
      "confidence": 4.5,
      ...
    }
  ]
}
```

## 2. ‚úÖ API Key Persistence Fixed
**Updated:** `apps/shared/app/pages/ai-extractor.vue`

### What Changed:
- Added comprehensive logging for API key save/load
- Better error messages
- Verification that data is actually saved to localStorage

### Debug Logs Added:
- `üíæ Attempting to save settings...`
- `‚úÖ Settings saved successfully to localStorage`
- `üîç Loading API config from localStorage...`
- `üìù Loaded config: { hasApiKey, apiKeyLength, model }`

### How It Works:
1. User enters API key ‚Üí Click "Verify"
2. If valid ‚Üí Click "Save Settings"
3. Saved to `localStorage` key: `rankify-ai-config`
4. On page refresh ‚Üí Automatically loads from localStorage
5. Auto-verifies the saved key

### Troubleshooting:
If API key still disappears:
1. Open browser console (F12)
2. Look for logs starting with üîç, üíæ, ‚úÖ
3. Check if localStorage is being blocked (incognito mode, browser settings)
4. Try: `localStorage.getItem('rankify-ai-config')` in console

## 3. ‚úÖ Enhanced Question Preview
**Updated:** `apps/shared/app/pages/ai-extractor.vue`

### What Changed:
- Shows **ALL questions** (not just 5)
- Scrollable container (500px max height)
- Custom styled scrollbar
- Better UI with:
  - Question numbering (Q1, Q2, Q3...)
  - Confidence badges with star icons
  - Option previews (first 2 options)
  - Diagram indicators with icons
  - Hover effects

### UI Improvements:
- Thicker borders (border-2)
- Colored confidence backgrounds
- Better spacing and padding
- Smooth hover animations
- Professional card design

## 4. ‚úÖ Better Data Flow to Review Interface
**Updated:** `apps/shared/app/pages/ai-extractor.vue` & `review-interface.vue`

### What Changed:
- Added comprehensive logging for data transfer
- Verifies data is saved before navigation
- Shows preview of saved data in console

### Debug Logs:
- `üíæ Saving to localStorage: { questionsCount, fileName }`
- `‚úÖ Data successfully saved to localStorage`
- `üìä Saved data preview: [first 2 questions]`
- `üöÄ Navigating to review interface...`

### Data Structure Saved:
```json
{
  "questions": [...],
  "fileName": "exam.pdf",
  "extractionMetadata": {
    "confidence": 4.2,
    "processingTime": 5000,
    "totalQuestions": 50,
    "timestamp": 1729785600000
  }
}
```

## Testing Checklist

### API Key Persistence:
- [ ] Enter API key and verify
- [ ] Save settings
- [ ] Refresh page
- [ ] Check if API key is still there
- [ ] Check console for logs

### Answer Extraction:
- [ ] Upload PDF with answer key
- [ ] Extract questions
- [ ] Export JSON
- [ ] Check if `correctAnswer` field is populated
- [ ] Verify answers match the PDF

### Question Preview:
- [ ] Extract questions
- [ ] Scroll through ALL questions
- [ ] Check if all questions are visible
- [ ] Verify UI looks good (borders, colors, spacing)

### Review Interface:
- [ ] Extract questions
- [ ] Click "Review Questions"
- [ ] Check console logs
- [ ] Verify questions appear in review interface
- [ ] Check if all data is transferred correctly

## Known Issues

### Browser Compatibility:
- localStorage might be blocked in:
  - Incognito/Private mode
  - Some browser security settings
  - Cross-origin iframes

### Workaround:
If localStorage doesn't work, the app will:
1. Show warning in console
2. Fall back to session-only storage
3. User needs to re-enter API key each session

## Future Improvements

1. **Encrypted Storage**: Store API key encrypted
2. **Backend Storage**: Save to database instead of localStorage
3. **Session Management**: Better handling of user sessions
4. **Answer Validation**: Verify extracted answers against options
5. **Bulk Export**: Export multiple extraction results at once
