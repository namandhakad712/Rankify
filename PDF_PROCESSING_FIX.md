# PDF Processing Fix - MuPDF to PDF.js Migration

## Problem
The AI Extractor was failing with WebAssembly errors when trying to process PDFs:
```
Failed to load PDF: WebAssembly initialization failed
Aborted(both async and sync fetching of the wasm failed)
```

## Root Cause
- MuPDF library requires WASM files to be properly served
- WASM files were not being loaded correctly in the Nuxt environment
- Browser couldn't fetch the required `.wasm` files

## Solution
Migrated from **MuPDF** to **PDF.js** (Mozilla's PDF library)

### Why PDF.js?
✅ Better browser compatibility
✅ More reliable in web environments
✅ Widely used and well-maintained
✅ Works seamlessly with Nuxt/Vue
✅ No complex WASM configuration needed
✅ CDN-hosted worker files available

## Changes Made

### 1. Updated `pdfProcessingUtils.ts`

#### Before (MuPDF):
```typescript
const mupdf = await import('mupdf')
const createMuPDF = (mupdf as any).createMuPDF
const instance = await createMuPDF()
this.pdfDoc = instance.load(new Uint8Array(pdfBuffer))
```

#### After (PDF.js):
```typescript
const pdfjsLib = await import('pdfjs-dist')
pdfjsLib.GlobalWorkerOptions.workerSrc = `//cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/pdf.js/${pdfjsLib.version}/pdf.worker.min.js`
const loadingTask = pdfjsLib.getDocument({ data: pdfBuffer })
this.pdfDoc = await loadingTask.promise
```

### 2. Updated Text Extraction
- Changed from MuPDF's `toStructuredText()` to PDF.js's `getTextContent()`
- Updated page iteration to use async/await properly
- Improved metadata extraction

### 3. Improved Error Handling
- Reduced retry attempts (1 instead of 2)
- Better error messages
- Added text validation (minimum 50 characters)
- More detailed console logging

### 4. Enhanced UI Error Display
- Added troubleshooting tips section
- Better visual styling for errors
- "Clear & Start Over" button
- Helpful suggestions for users

## Installation
```bash
npm install pdfjs-dist --legacy-peer-deps
```

## Testing
1. Navigate to `/ai-extractor`
2. Configure API key in Settings
3. Upload a PDF file
4. Click "Start AI Extraction"
5. PDF should now process successfully ✅

## Benefits
- ✅ No more WASM errors
- ✅ Faster PDF loading
- ✅ Better error messages
- ✅ More reliable extraction
- ✅ Works in all modern browsers

## Files Modified
1. `apps/shared/app/utils/pdfProcessingUtils.ts` - Migrated to PDF.js
2. `apps/shared/app/utils/aiExtractionUtils.ts` - Improved error handling
3. `apps/shared/app/pages/ai-extractor.vue` - Enhanced error UI
4. `package.json` - Added pdfjs-dist dependency

## Next Steps
- Test with various PDF formats
- Monitor for any edge cases
- Consider adding OCR support for scanned PDFs (future enhancement)
